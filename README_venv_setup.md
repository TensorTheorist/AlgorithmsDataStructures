The following line of code will create a new virtual environment in the hidden folder `.venv` under root:
`python3 -m venv .venv`
The above line considers `python3` installation on the system, should be replaced by `python` depending  on the Python version/installation on the system.
The command `source .venv/bin/activate` will activate the virtual environment.
